# Single cell replication package

This package contains a series of vignettes that reproduce published
SCP data analyses. Emphasis is put on standardization of the workflows.

## Prerequisites

All vignettes are pre-compiled and can be found on the
[website](https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/SCP.replication/index.html)
under the `Articles` tab.

The replication package can be installed with R >= 4.1 by running:

```
BiocManager::install("UCLouvain/SCP.replication")
```


## Reproduction of SCP data analyses

The currently available reproduction vignettes are listed below.
