              mass-spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data analysis. Since its
              first release in 2008, it has grown substantially in
              functionality and can be used in conjunction with more MS
              platforms. Here we present an updated protocol covering the most
              important basic computational workflows, including those designed
              for quantitative label-free proteomics, MS1-level labeling and
              isobaric labeling techniques. This protocol presents a complete
              description of the parameters used in MaxQuant, as well as of the
              configuration options of its integrated search engine, Andromeda.
              This protocol update describes an adaptation of an existing
              protocol that substantially modifies the technique. Important
              concepts of shotgun proteomics and their implementation in
              MaxQuant are briefly reviewed, including different quantification
              strategies and the control of false-discovery rates (FDRs), as
              well as the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs).
              The MaxQuant output tables, which contain information about
              quantification of proteins and PTMs, are explained in detail.
              Furthermore, we provide a short version of the workflow that is
              applicable to data sets with simple and standard experimental
              designs. The MaxQuant algorithms are efficiently parallelized on
              multiple processors and scale well from desktop computers to
              servers with many cores. The software is written in C\# and is

              unmodified, low-cost commercial robotic pipetting platform was
              utilized for one-pot sample preparation. We used low-volume
              384-well plates and periodically added water or buffer to the
              microwells to compensate for limited evaporation during sample
              incubation. Prepared samples were analyzed directly from the well

              to our previously developed nanoPOTS platform. To evaluate
              clinical feasibility, we identified an average of 1095 protein
              groups from âˆ¼130 sorted B or T lymphocytes. We anticipate that

              important challenges on the data analysis because of
              peptide-specific effects and context dependent missingness of
              peptide intensities. Peptide-based workflows, like MSqRob, test
              for DE directly from peptide intensities and outperform
              summarization methods which first aggregate MS1 peptide
              intensities to protein intensities before DE analysis. However,
              these methods are computationally expensive, often hard to
              understand for the non-specialized end-user, and do not provide
              protein summaries, which are important for visualization or
              downstream processing. In this work, we therefore evaluate
              state-of-the-art summarization strategies using a benchmark
              spike-in dataset and discuss why and when these fail compared
              with the state-of-the-art peptide based model, MSqRob. Based on
              this evaluation, we propose a novel summarization strategy,
              MSqRobSum, which estimates MSqRob's model parameters in a
              two-stage procedure circumventing the drawbacks of peptide-based

              while providing useful protein expression summaries for plotting

              intensities considerably reduces the computational complexity,
              the memory footprint and the model complexity, and makes it
              easier to disseminate DE inferred on protein summaries. Moreover,
              MSqRobSum provides a highly modular analysis framework, which
              provides researchers with full flexibility to develop data

              to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical
              considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require
              the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is
              inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch

              cells. This process, however, remains challenging for smaller
              samples, such as the proteomes of single mammalian cells, because
              reduced protein levels reduce the number of confidently sequenced
              peptides. To alleviate this reduction, we developed Data-driven
              Alignment of Retention Times for IDentification (DART-ID).
              DART-ID implements principled Bayesian frameworks for global

              functional and molecular phenotypes. This diversity is largely
              unexplored at the level of single-cell proteomes because of the
              limitations of quantitative single-cell protein analysis.
              RESULTS: To overcome this limitation, we develop SCoPE2, which
              substantially increases quantitative accuracy and throughput
              while lowering cost and hands-on time by introducing automated
              and miniaturized sample preparation. These advances enable us to
              analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as homogeneous
              monocytes differentiate into macrophage-like cells in the absence
              of polarizing cytokines. SCoPE2 quantifies over 3042 proteins in
              1490 single monocytes and macrophages in 10 days of instrument
              time, and the quantified proteins allow us to discern single
              cells by cell type. Furthermore, the data uncover a continuous
              gradient of proteome states for the macrophages, suggesting that
              macrophage heterogeneity may emerge in the absence of polarizing
              cytokines. Parallel measurements of transcripts by 10$\times$
              Genomics suggest that our measurements sample 20-fold more
              protein copies than RNA copies per gene, and thus, SCoPE2
              supports quantification with improved count statistics. This
              allowed exploring regulatory interactions, such as interactions
              between the tumor suppressor p53, its transcript, and the
              transcripts of genes regulated by p53. CONCLUSIONS: Even in a
              homogeneous environment, macrophage proteomes are heterogeneous.
              This heterogeneity correlates to the inflammatory axis of
              classically and alternatively activated macrophages. Our
              methodology lays the foundation for automated and quantitative
              single-cell analysis of proteins by mass spectrometry and

               importance in order to capture biological heterogeneity within
               complex cell systems, but have largely been limited to RNA-based
               technologies. Here we present a comprehensive benchmarked
               experimental and computational workflow, which establishes
               global single-cell mass spectrometry-based proteomics as a tool
               for large-scale single-cell analyses. By exploiting a primary
               leukemia model system, we demonstrate both through
               pre-enrichment of cell populations and through a non-enriched
               unbiased approach that our workflow enables the exploration of
               cellular heterogeneity within this aberrant developmental
               hierarchy. Our approach is capable of consistently quantifying
               ~1000 proteins per cell across thousands of individual cells
               using limited instrument time. Furthermore, we develop a
               computational workflow (SCeptre) that effectively normalizes the
               data, integrates available FACS data and facilitates downstream
               analysis. The approach presented here lays a foundation for

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is actively
              embracing quantitative, single-cell level analyses. Indeed,
              recent advances in sample preparation and mass spectrometry (MS)
              have enabled the emergence of quantitative MS-based single-cell
              proteomics (SCP). While exciting and promising, SCP still has
              many rough edges. The current analysis workflows are custom and
              built from scratch. The field is therefore craving for
              standardized software that promotes principled and reproducible
              SCP data analyses. AREAS COVERED: This special report is the
              first step toward the formalization and standardization of SCP
              data analysis. scp, the software that accompanies this work,
              successfully replicates one of the landmark SCP studies and is
              applicable to other experiments and designs. We created a
              repository containing the replicated workflow with comprehensive
              documentation in order to favor further dissemination and
              improvements of SCP data analyses. EXPERT OPINION: Replicating
              SCP data analyses uncovers important challenges in SCP data
              analysis. We describe two such challenges in detail: batch
              correction and data missingness. We provide the current
              state-of-the-art and illustrate the associated limitations. We
              also highlight the intimate dependence that exists between batch
              effects and data missingness and offer avenues for dealing with
              these exciting challenges.",

ABSTRACT = {Myeloid leukemic cells are intrinsically under oxidative stress due to impaired reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, a common signature of several hematological malignancies. The present review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of aberrant ROS production in myeloid leukemia cells as well as on the redox-dependent signaling pathways involved in the leukemogenic process. Finally, the relevance of new chemotherapy options that specifically exert their pharmacological activity by altering the cellular redox imbalance will be discussed as an effective strategy to eradicate chemoresistant cells.},
